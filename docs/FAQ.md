# FAQ
**Tweets fail but retweets work?**  
The account is likely limited or requires verification. Post once manually, then rerun the bot.

**Reply editor not found?**  
Enable `emulateMobile: true` or force `Accept-Language: en-US` in the script.

**What goes in target files?**  
- like.txt / retweet.txt: one tweet URL per line  
- follow.txt / unfollow.txt: one profile URL per line  
- tweets.txt: one text per line  
- replies.txt: `<tweet_url>|<reply text>`
